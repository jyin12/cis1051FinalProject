Overall, I really loved the process of creating a game. This is actually my first game that I have ever developed and the fun part is being creative. I tend to have more of a
creative mind and that is part of developing successful innovation. I came across the game, Flappy Bird and I'd thought I could make an upgraded version. I really like Studio 
Ghibli (even though I have never watched a single movie from them...yeah I know) and the images I see on Google was so aesthetic. I liked "My Neighbor Totoro" because I thought 
the cat was cute. I started gathering images and characters to use. I used PyGame to develop "Flying Totoro" and I had little to no experience in using PyGame. So I watched tutorials on YouTube to understand how PyGame works and is set up. I got into Flappy Bird game using Pygame and I followed the steps they had. I played around with the game speed they had and formatting the screens or images. I learned that in PyGame, there's a built in function that if an image "collides" with another image, I can play around on what will happen. For example, the Totoro crashes the gate or on the floor the game restarts until user hits the space bar. There's a flexibility with choosing how I want an object to act. I really liked this learning experience and hopefully, I can do more game development in my free time.
