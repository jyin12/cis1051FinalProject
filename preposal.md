# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I wanted to do something related to data science or even machine learning or even games.
Since I just took principles of data science last semester and being a
beginner/intermediate level python coder, I'm looking for something that is doable 
and for me to learn at the same time.
 
Some ideas:
+ Lane detection reader
+ Calorie tracker? (requires me to learn Django)
+ Facial recognition to find out gender and/or age or even mood
+ A better Flappy Bird game
+ Website blocker
+ Story walk-through game (like the story about a vampire at McDonald's)

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

No, I plan to do this project individually

## Do you have any questions of your own?

As working individually, how much workload should I put in for each week?
Since I have my capstone project (about weather prediction using machine learning),
and other classes, I don't want to put on too much workload for this project.
