# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

I haven't really thought of it, but I want to build an updated Flappy Bird game or
a very basic rpg game.

Names for the Flappy Bird game:
+ Flying Birds
+ Super Birds
+ Golden Birds

Names for the RPG game:
+ Top Gun
+ Astoria's World
+ Astrocraft

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Flappy Bird: An updated version of previous Flappy Bird where users play with same rules, but
with treasure collection and levels. The treasure collection will worth a lot more points and by
collecting them, it allows users to level up in the game like unlock customization of
their birds or something along the line.

RPG Game: A very basic "shooting the enemy" game. It will include point achievements 
where users can get badges/medals based on the scores they have. Very similar to the
Flappy Bird scoring system.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Flappy Bird: In this game, there will be PyGame involved. Some cool features I'd like
to include are grabbing tokens and win to next level up. Medals/achievements will be
included as well. I also want to include background change based on device system time
so it gives the sense of users playing the game at this time/moment.
Basically, it still does what the original Flappy Bird does but
with level up features. The level-up feature will be based on how many times the user
passes between the pipes. The higher the score, the game will level-up and win medals.

RPG: This will have PyGame involved as well. This will be a very basic RPG where 
the avatar will jump and hide behind the blocks when an enemy is seen. To win the game,
the user will have to shoot all the enemies and win the level. The higher the level is,
more challenging it gets.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I mean I am taking capstone class (CIS 4398: Projects in CS), my team and I are building
weather prediction using machine learning. This project does not really relate to the
games that I want to propose. But if I am allow to, I can maybe showcase both projects?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Game: A good feature is by showing the basics of the Flappy Bird game with background change
based on time of the day.

Capstone project: A good (lowkey the best) feature to show is displaying predicted hourly weather
temperatures from machine learning algorithm that is stored in AWS.
+ Side note: this project is making progress already from the beginning of the semester
until now. We used Jira as part of the agile development, so it's good that we use it
to keep track of our progress while working in a group. I only put it here because it
will be shown by the deadline.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better feature is by showing the user can collect the tokens that are shown while
playing.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A best feature to show is having level-up and winning medal feature in the game.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps will be to learn PyGame and how they work. I have worked on PyGame before
but only the very basics of it. I will learn through by watching tutorials online like
YouTube and play around in IDE using PyGame. I hope by end of this project, I can
develop another game using PyGame.
