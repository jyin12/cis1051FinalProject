Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have started to learn the basics of PyGame and I'm getting the gist of it.
Before coding, I found images for the updated Flappy Bird game to make it "Studio
Ghibli" themed.
I implemented the screen and background already. The moving base is working well.


#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't started implementing the pipes yet and the "bird". I will be starting
this week to put in the token to show up on screen so players can collect them to
earn extra points

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

No problems, everything looks okay.
